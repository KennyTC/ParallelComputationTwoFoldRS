# ParallelComputationTwoFoldRS
Implement parallel computing of `Reducts` in RoughSet using Hadoop's Map-Reduce.
- Using Map-Reduct, the calculation of `Reducts` in RoughSet is faster and more efficient.
- Map-Reduce allows RoughSet can deal with large data, which is nearly impossible with the original RoughSet
- The implementation is in Java.
